BOX I.C.I.a.ii. Transects for monitoring vegetation response to pumping [link](https://zach-nelson.github.io/wflow-veg/report.html).

Archived for reproducibility -  line point intercept data compared to baseline (BOX I.C.I.a.ii). This format provides the functions, code and version history of the annual vegetation calculations necessitated by BOX I.C.I.a.ii of the Agreement.


>The `workflowr` R package helps researchers organize their analyses in a way that promotes effective project management, reproducibility, collaboration, and sharing of results. Workflowr combines literate programming (knitr and rmarkdown) and version control (Git, via git2r) to generate a website containing time-stamped, versioned, and documented results.[github](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr)

>The `targets` R package is a Make-like pipeline toolkit for statistics and data science in R. With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. targets skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs the necessary computation with implicit parallel computing, and abstracts files as R objects. A fully up-to-date targets pipeline is tangible evidence that the output aligns with the code and data, which substantiates trust in the results.[github](https://github.com/ropensci/targets)
